# Red-Black Trees

### History

This note will talk about the traditional Red-Black Trees algorithms. This original data structure was invented in 1972 by [Rudolf Bayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Bayer) and named "symmetric binary B-Tree", but acquired its modern name in a paper in 1978 by [Leonidas J. Guibas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_J._Guibas) and [Robert Sedgewick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)) entitled "A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees".
